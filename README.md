* Requires transformers, torch, the general conda install.
* Run by typing `python main.py`. 
* By default, will run using semantic embeddings. If you want to try the highly experimental finetuned model, run `python main.py llm`.
* Right now this will only work on MacOS as it uses on-device speech recognition (using the `hear` library/app).
* It much be launched within Terminal, not iTerm, for `hear` to appropriately request Speech Recognition and Microphone permissions. See https://github.com/sveinbjornt/hear/issues/15
* It would be trivial to add whisper, feel free to do so and send me a pull request.
